# AIM Modules

Repository with all modules that are of interest and are meant to connect to databases, etc. The modules in this repository are able to run with YARP middleware, and some of them are okay with other types of middleware too.

For now we focus first on the "sources" and "sinks" for a type of dataflow architecture that we are building. Later on we will make sure that there will be more "algorithmic oriented" building blocks in here.
