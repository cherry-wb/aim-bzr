 * @brief 
 *
 * This file is created at Almende B.V. It is open-source software and part of the Common 
 * Hybrid Agent Platform (CHAP). A toolbox with a lot of open-source tools, ranging from 
 * thread pools and TCP/IP components to control architectures and learning algorithms. 
 * This software is published under the GNU Lesser General Public license (LGPL).
 *
 * It is not possible to add usage restrictions to an open-source license. Nevertheless,
 * we personally strongly object against this software being used by the military, in the
 * bio-industry, for animal experimentation, or anything that violates the Universal
 * Declaration of Human Rights.
