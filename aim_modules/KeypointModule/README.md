# KeypointModule

This module gets keypoints in images. There are many keypoints available. Patented ones like SIFT and SURF, but also ones that can be used freely, such as there are BRISK, BRIEF, and ORB. The goal is to provide a module that allows you to get keypoints and descriptors of an image that you hand over. For now, this code is intertwined with code that uses the keypoints and descriptors to obtain information on egomotion.
