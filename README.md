# AIM Tools
AIM stands for Artificial Intelligence Modules

## What does it do?
The AIM tools are meant for management of separate modules that each have AI functionality. They can be compared with the utilities that are provided with ROS, such as roscreate-pkg etc (of which I was not aware), or with nodejs, such as npm (of which I was neither aware). The tools work together with [rur-builder](https://github.com/mrquincle/rur-builder), a python backend for omniidl. 

The current AIM tools are tailored to [YARP](http://eris.liralab.it/yarp/) and generate code that makes it easy to work with YARP as middleware. However, nothing prevents further extensions to make it easier to wrap code as ROS modules or something else, even Java. It depends on the backends provided by the forementioned rur-builder.

## Is it good?
The maturity of this software can be improved.

## What are the alternatives?
There are no alternatives that we know of.
