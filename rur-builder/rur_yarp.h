 * @brief Example file for a to-be-generated header from IPL to a YARP module
 *
 * This file is created at Almende B.V. It is open-source software and part of the Common
 * Hybrid Agent Platform (CHAP). A toolbox with a lot of open-source tools, ranging from
 * thread pools and TCP/IP components to control architectures and learning algorithms.
 * This software is published under the GNU Lesser General Public license (LGPL).
 *
 * It is not possible to add usage restrictions to an open-source license. Nevertheless,
 * we personally strongly object against this software used by the military, in the
 * bio-industry, for animal experimentation, or anything that violates the Universal
 * Declaration of Human Rights.

/**
 * The RUR compiler (a set of back-ends for the omniidl compiler) generates a reference
 * header file for different languages (Java, C++). This reference header is subsequently
 * re-generated for a specific targeted middleware solution (YARP, ROS, AgentScape).
 *
 * The IDL (component specification) file does not contain all information, for example,
 * it does not need to define the Init() functions, etc. Basically, it only contains a
 * very selected subset of elements that are needed to create this header file (besides
 * knowledge from the yarp library), nothing more. The intention of the IDL file is to
 * have a stable/standardized interface, even if the yarp library changes. It is not
 * meant to be able to generate a yarp header file from the IDL without any additional
 * information.
 *
 * Exogenous coordination
 * An important design decision is to allow only for exogenous coordination. A component
 * is not allowed to set up its wiring to other components itself. This is the
 * responsibility of another/third entity. In practice, this means that if you have
 * already a YARP component and wants to use it in the RUR framework, you'll have to
 * remove the "startup" and "shutdown" code w.r.t. connect() and disconnect() calls and
 * create a separate Wirer IDL description (about which later).
