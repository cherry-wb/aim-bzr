          <h3>Welcome to AIM</h3>

<p>
AIM stands for Artificial Intelligence Modules, but is much more than that. AIM is inspired by three recent movements in practical computer science. First, in the robotics community there is a need for a wide range of functionalities, from computer vision, navigation and mapping, to sensor fusion, and machine learning, which lead to several frameworks that allow people to collaborate: <a href="http://eris.liralab.it/yarp">YARP</a> (Yet Another Robot Platform), <a href="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a> (Robot Operating System), <a href="http://www.urbiforge.org">URBI</a> (Universal Real-time Behavior Interface) to name a few. Second, there are market infrastructures to distributed your applications: <a href="https://play.google.com">Google play</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/">Apple app store</a>, and let's hope also an online presence later of the excellent package managers like apt-get in the form of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~dobots/+archive/ppa">Launchpad package archives</a> and the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE build service</a>. Third, there are frameworks to allow you to implement or reveal functionality in the cloud, from <a href="http://www.zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>, a distributed transport layer used in Twitter <a href="http://storm-project.net/">Storm</a>, to <a href="http://mahout.apache.org/">Mahout</a>, scalable Map/Reduce based machine learning libraries. </p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
The goal of AIM is threefold:
<ul>
<li>A <b>middleware-agnostic</b> modular approach to writing code: the "rur-builder". 
<li>A <b>distributed market place</b>: the "aimserver".
<li>Software that is inherently <b>scalable and runs on servers</b> as smoothly as one robots or smartphones.
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<p>
The <b>rur-builder</b> is loosely similar to <a href="http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/soft/architecture/genom3">Genom3</a>. It does not create some additional library that has to be linked to all middlewares from YARP, ROS, to URBI, instead it uses a code generator, that generates dedicated interface files. However, different from Genom3 the code is not "enriched" with meta-information. The meta-information is by virtue of a specific IDL file, that describes the interface of a module in a general sense. This means that code completion still works: there are no tcl-statements through the code that makes indexing difficult.</p>

<p>
The current rur-builder provides functionality for different backends. Currently supported are <b>YARP</b>, <b>ROS</b>, and <b>ZeroMQ</b> as middleware between the different AI modules. To be able to use ZeroMQ as middleware solution a nameserver is implemented, called "zmqserver", and "zmqconnect", a connect utility (allowing exogenous coordination: start two modules separately and only later on connect them together).
</p>

<p>
The <b>aimserver</b> (forthcoming) is a REST server that allows people to find AI modules across a wide range of repositories. Moreover, it provides functionality to compile the code found, run it, stop it, and connect modules together. Towards that purpose there is a range of tools to create, register, copy, and connect AI modules: "aimtools".

<h3>How to get it?</h3>
<p>
You can get the code from <a href="https://github.com/mrquincle/aim-bzr">github.com</a>, but the easiest way to get the code is via <a href="https://launchpad.net/~dobots/+archive/ppa">Launchpad</a>:

<pre><code>$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dobots/ppa # press ENTER if asked for confirmation
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install aim
$dpkg -L aim</code></pre>

</p>
